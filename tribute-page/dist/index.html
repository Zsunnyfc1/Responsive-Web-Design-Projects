    <h3 id="headline">Here is a time line of Alan Turing's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1912</strong> - Born in Maida Vale, London.</li>
      <li><strong>1936</strong> - Published the paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" which later become known as "Turing's Proof", and introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" target="_blank">Turing Machines</a>, that formed the concept of algorithms and computations for computer science.</li>
      <li><strong>1938</strong> - During the second World War, Turing was breaking German ciphers at Bletchley Park. He devised a machine called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe" target="_blank">Bombe</a> to crack the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine" target="_blank">German Enigma cipher machine.</a></li>
      <li><strong>1942</strong> - Devised a technique  named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turingery" target="_blank">Turingery</a> that was used against the German Lorenz cipher messages.</li>
      <li><strong>1946</strong> - Was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire(OBE) by King George VI for his wartime services.</li>
      <li><strong>1950</strong> - Wrote the paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" that introduced the experiment known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="_blank">Turing test</a> to see if artificial intelligence could exhibit intelligent behavior identical to a humans.</li>
      <li><strong>1952</strong> - Convicted for homosexuality which were criminal offenses in the United Kingdom during that time period, Turing was chemically castrated.</li>
      <li><strong>1954</strong> - Was found dead in his house and was believed that he commited suicide with cyanide poisoning.</li>
    <li><strong>2009</strong> - A petition was started by John Graham-Cumming who urged the British Government to apologise for Turing's prosecution as a homosexual. The petition was a success, and the Prime Minister released a statement apologising and stating that the treatment of Turing was "appalling."</li>
      <li><strong>2013</strong> - Queen Elizabeth II immediately signed a pardon for Turing's conviction on December 24, 2013.</li>
      <li><strong>2014</strong> - Queen Elizabeth II announced Turing was officially pardoned in August 22, 2014.</li>
      <li><strong>2016</strong> - The United Kingdom passed a new law termed the "Alan Turing law" which served as an amnesty to pardon men who were convicted for homosexual acts under historical legislation.</li>
